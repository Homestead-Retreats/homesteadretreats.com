        <p className="facilites-second-p">We know that one of the most important parts of a great camp, retreat or conference is the food. Ask around and you will discover that we have a reputation for quality meals with generous portion, served with our own Homestead hospitality. We pride ourselves in preparing delicious, homemade meals. We serve many churches and Christian ministries every year and we receive many unsolicited comments. The three comments that are consistently mentioned in the thank you cards are our clean facilities, service, and delicious food.</p>
